Infrared spectroscropy of normal atmosphere and methane.

## Notes on data files
All raw data recorded is present in the `data/session1` and `data/session2` folders. Data considered suitable for use for analysis has been copied to the `data` folder itself. These files have been renamed to increase clarity about their contents.
These are

Current Filename | Original Filename | Air | Slit Width (mm) | Diffraction Grating (lines/mm) | Wavelength Range (nm) | Wavelength Spacing (nm) | Notes
---------------- | ----------------- | --- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -----
Ambient low res | Ambient 300diff 1mm slit.csv | Ambient atmosphere | 1 | 300 | 1000 - 4500 | 10 | Low resolution
Ambient high res | Ambient high res 300diff 1-25mm slit.csv | Ambient atmosphere | 1.25 | 300 | 4150 - 4400 | 0.5 | High resolution look at CO2 absorption
Methane (sample A) low res | S2smpAlow.csv | Methane (Sample A) | 1 | 300 | 1000 - 4500 | 10 | Low resolution
Methane (sample A) high res | S2smpAhighPR2 (01).csv | Methane (Sample A) | 1 | 300 | 3140 - 3500 | 0.5 | Only measurement we made of this type that wasn't ruined by noise
Methane (sample X) low res | S2smpXlow.csv | Methane (Sample X) | 1 | 300 | 1000 - 4599 | 10 | Low resolution. Clearly not a match to expected spectrum for methane, so we concluded this was the impure sample.
